## üå± TaskFlow: Evolution, Features & Limitations

### **From Portfolio to Scalable Solution**

- **Started as a portfolio project** but evolved into a full-fledged productivity app.
- **Goal**: Simplify digital productivity with a task-focused experience.
- **Crafted with care**: Every aspect of TaskFlow, from frontend to backend, was thoughtfully developed to follow best practices, emphasizing security and user-focused design.

### **Accessibility (a11y)**

- **Inclusive Design**: TaskFlow is built with the goal of making the app accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with continuous improvement in mind.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: TaskFlow is fully optimized for keyboard navigation, allowing users to interact with the app without relying on a mouse or touch input.
- **ARIA Support**: ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes are used only when necessary, to enhance accessibility without cluttering the markup, ensuring an optimized experience for screen readers and assistive technologies.
- **Semantic HTML**: The app utilizes semantic HTML elements, not only for SEO benefits but also to improve the user experience, making it easier for assistive technology to interpret the content structure correctly.
- **Colorblind-Friendly**: The app‚Äôs theme handler offers multiple color schemes to cater to different preferences. However, I'm aware that it may not work well for users with colorblindness. Future updates will focus on adding color schemes that are more accessible and better aligned with accessibility standards.


### **Scalable Architecture**

- **Dedicated API server** for seamless communication.
- **Separate MySQL database** to handle user data securely.
- **Email service** supporting future growth (currently on a free tier with a limit of 100 emails per day, easily upgradable).

### **Security First**

- TaskFlow is designed with **strong security measures** to protect user data.
- However, **no app is completely secure**. Ongoing vigilance and improvements are always necessary due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity.

### **Built for Growth**

- **Modular design** ensures the app can scale with increasing user needs.
- **TaskFlow is more than just a task manager**. It is a showcase of clean architecture, efficient UX design, and scalable backend practices.
