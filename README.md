# TaskFlow ‚Äì Minimalist Productivity, Maximum Focus

![Taskflow app screenshot](./docs/assets/images/taskflow-screenshot-1.png)

## üìã About

[TaskFlow](https://taskflowapp.net/) is a fully deployed productivity web application with a modular architecture designed to help users stay focused, organized, and distraction-free. Built as a custom single page application using vanilla JavaScript with an object oriented MVC architecture, it delivers a smooth and responsive user experience. 

The frontend is bundled with Webpack and Babel while interacting with a secure RESTful API built in pure PHP, also following object oriented MVC design. The API is protected with JWT authentication and configured to handle CORS for secure cross-origin requests. Access control is enforced using Redis based rate limiting, while data persistence is managed separately with MySQL to ensure reliable storage. The interface is clean, accessible, and intuitive, supporting task management, reminders, and progress tracking. All designed with simplicity and usability in mind.

### üì± Progressive Web App (PWA) Support

TaskFlow supports basic Progressive Web App (PWA) features with a `manifest.json` file. Modern browsers allow users to add websites to their phone‚Äôs home screen using the ‚ÄúAdd to Home Screen‚Äù option, and TaskFlow works seamlessly with this. When launched from the home screen, the app shows a proper icon and is optimized for mobile devices. Although it currently runs inside the browser, future updates will add full native-like PWA support for an even smoother app experience.


### üåü Acknowledgements

This project draws inspiration from several sources that helped shape its development:

- The **API and JWT structure** was inspired by *APIs in PHP: From Basic to Advanced* by Dave Hollingworth. His channel and documentation also helped me configure Composer.
- The **vanilla SPA (Single Page Application) design** was inspired by *Build a Single Page Application with JavaScript (No Frameworks)* by dcode. While the final router is completely different from his, I learned about the vanilla SPA concept from him.
- The overall project, including its **UI and UX**, was designed mostly by me. However, the **quote machine UI** design was inspired by a project from FreeCodeCamp.
- Several **YouTube tutorials** and **forums** provided valuable insights, from technical documentation to server security and deployment. Special thanks to Net Ninja, an exceptional web development teacher on YouTube. Most of my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript comes from his tutorials. His clear explanations were my starting point, and his content kept me motivated and helped me push through when I was just beginning.

## üß™ Local Development

In this guide, I'll walk you through setting up **TaskFlow** locally using **XAMPP** for the API and **Composer** for managing PHP dependencies, but feel free to use any stack or tools you prefer. The following technologies are used in this setup:

- **XAMPP** (Apache, PHP, MySQL) for the backend
- **Redis** running via **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** for rate limiting
- **Apache Virtual Hosts** for clean URL routing
- **Composer** to manage PHP dependencies and autoloading
- **Webpack and Babel** for client-side development and bundling
- **Node & Express server** to serve the final Webpack build (though you can use your preferred server setup)

### üíª API Local Setup

#### Clone the repository

It must be cloned in `C:/xampp/htdocs/` to be able to use it with XAMPP.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AngelValentino/taskflow-api.git
```

- Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, which are required for  **PHPMailer**, **phpdotenv**, and **Predis**. Composer will also handle the autoloading capabilities for the project.
  
  ```bash
  composer install
  ```

#### Set up Apache Virtual Host

Configure a custom local domain for your API (e.g., `taskflow-api.com`) to support proper routing, as well as serving files from public folder.

- Edit your `httpd-vhosts.conf` file (located in `C:/xampp/apache/conf/extra/`):
  
  ```apache
  <VirtualHost *:80>
      DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/taskflow-api/public"
      ServerName taskflow-api.com
      <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/taskflow-api/public">
          Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
          AllowOverride All
          Require all granted
      </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>
  ```

  Enables Apache to use `.htaccess` files for URL rewriting, security, and routing. Setting the document root to the `public` folder ensures only publicly accessible files are served, keeping internal files secure.

- Add the domain to your system's `hosts` file (`C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts`):
  
  ```
  127.0.0.1       taskflow-api.com
  ```

  Ensures that when you visit `taskflow-api.com` in your browser, it will route to your local machine (127.0.0.1) instead of trying to find the domain on the internet.

#### Set up the `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project (if it doesn't exist), and define the required environment variables. These configure the database, Redis, email service, JWT authentication, CORS and environment-specific settings.

```env
# Environment 
APP_ENV="development"    # Set to 'development' or 'production'

# Client URLs
CLIENT_URL_DEV="http://localhost:3000"    # Development client URL
CLIENT_URL_PROD="https://yourdomain.com"    # Production client URL

# Allowed Origins (comma-separated if multiple)
DEVELOPMENT_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000"
PRODUCTION_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com"

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST="127.0.0.1"
DB_PORT="3306"
DB_NAME="your_database_name"
DB_USER="your_database_user"
DB_PASSWORD="your_database_password"
DB_SSL="false"    # Set to "true" if using SSL
DB_SSL_CA="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----..."    # Required only if DB_SSL is "true"

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST="127.0.0.1"
REDIS_PORT="6379"

# Mail Configuration
MAIL_HOST="smtp.yourprovider.com"
SENDER_EMAIL="you@example.com"
SENDER_PASSWORD="your_email_password"
SENDER_USERNAME="your_name"
SENDER_PORT="587"   # Your provider specified port

# JWT Secret Key
SECRET_KEY="your_super_secret_key"
```

#### Start Apache and MySQL via XAMPP

- **Start Apache and MySQL**: 
  Open the XAMPP control panel and ensure that both **Apache** and **MySQL** services are running.

- **Place the Project in XAMPP's `htdocs/` Folder**
  If the project directory isn't already there, move it to the `htdocs/` folder. For example:
  
  ```bash
  C:/xampp/htdocs/taskflow
  ```

- **Start Redis in WSL**
  
  ```bash
  redis-server
  ```

  Make sure Redis is running and accessible from the PHP backend for proper rate limiting.


### üíæ MySQL DB Local Setup

#### Import MySQL Schema

Use **phpMyAdmin** or the **MySQL CLI** to import the provided schema SQL files into your database. The `schema.sql` and `queries.sql` files can be found in the `docs/assets/db` folder. Alternatively, you can click [here](./docs/assets/db) to access them directly.

### üåê Client Vanilla SPA Local Setup

#### Clone the repository

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AngelValentino/TaskFlow.git
  ```

- Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, which are required for **Webpack**, **Babel**, and the **Node.js express** server:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### Development and Production

- For development with Webpack (live reloading and hot module replacement), run:
  
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- To create the final production build, run:
  
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- To create the Express server serving the final build run:
  
  ```
  npm run start
  ```
